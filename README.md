### Quick Setup Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages
   - Select branch: `main` (or `master`)
   - Select folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

2. **For Root URL** (e.g., `https://username.github.io/`):
   - Rename your repository to `username.github.io` (must match your GitHub username exactly)
   - The site will be available at the root URL

3. **For Project URL** (e.g., `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`):
   - Keep your current repository name
   - The site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

## Important Notes

- The repository must be **public** (for free GitHub Pages)
- After enabling Pages, it may take a few minutes for the site to be available
- Make sure all your files are committed and pushed to the repository
- All assets (CSS, images, etc.) use relative paths for proper deployment
